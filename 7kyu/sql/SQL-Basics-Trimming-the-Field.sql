-- You have access to a table of monsters as follows:

-- monsters schema
    -- id
    -- name
    -- legs
    -- arms
    -- characteristics

-- The monsters in the provided table have too many characteristics, they really only need one each. 
-- Your job is to trim the characteristics down so that each monster only has one. If there is only one already, provide that. 
-- If there are multiple, provide only the first one (don't leave any commas in there).

-- You must return a table with the format as follows:

-- output schema
    -- id
    -- name
    -- characteristic

-- Order by id


--  My Solution
SELECT
    id,
    name,
    CASE
        WHEN POSITION(',' IN characteristics) > 0 THEN SPLIT_PART(characteristics, ',', 1)
        ELSE characteristics
    END AS characteristic
FROM monsters
ORDER BY id
